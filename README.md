# pi5-camera-in-docker

This project is a fork of [pi-camera-in-docker](https://github.com/hyzhak/pi-camera-in-docker), which didn't work on the Raspberry Pi 5. I updated the version of the Docker image and the Raspberry Pi repository. With these changes, it is now possible to install a newer version of picamera2 that supports the Raspberry Pi 5.
